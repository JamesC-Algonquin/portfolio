          <p>
            I am a programmer based in Moncton, New Brunswick. I've been working on my computer programming skills since 2018,
            and I've always had an interest in anything computer or technology related.
            
            Other interests include music and martial arts. I play drums and piano, and I'm currently learning to play electric guitar. 
            I have a first-degree black belt in Shotokan Karate and instruct classes on the weekends.
            
            I am also trilingual, speaking English, French, and Japanese. Contrary to common belief, my last name "Ching" is not 
            of Japanese origin (or Asian at all, for that matter), but is actually English in origin.
          </p>
        <h2>Education and Skills</h2>
        <p>Graduated with honours and 3.96/4.0 GPA from the Computer Programming course at Algonquin College.</p>
