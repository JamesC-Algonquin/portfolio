          <p>
            I am a programmer based in Moncton, New Brunswick. I've been working on my computer programming skills since high school,
            and have always had an interest in anything computer or technology related.
            <br/>
            Aside from computer programming, I have an interest in music, as well as martial arts. I've been playing drums locally
            for 7 years, and can also play piano and electric guitar. I have a first-degree black belt in Shotokan Karate, and instruct
            classes on the weekends.
            <br/>
            I am also trilingual, speaking English, French, and Japanese. I am half Canadian and half Japanese, and contrary to common 
            belief, my last name "Ching" is not of Japanese origin (or Asian at all, for that matter), but is actually English in origin.
          </p>
