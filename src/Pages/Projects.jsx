      <h2>This Website</h2>
      <p>This website itself is actually a project demonstration in itself.
        <br/>
        It is coded entirely using the React JavaScript framework, implementing an intuitive navigation menu 
        and animated transitions between pages.

        <p>The "NASA Image of the Day" project is an Android based application that displayed images from NASA's APOD library.
          For reference, APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) 
          is an <a href='https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/archivepixFull.html' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online archive</a> to which 
          NASA posts a new image every day, with an associated description of the image. This application queries an API using specific
          dates to download images and their associated data from the archive. It is capable of displaying the current image based on the local time/date,
          displaying a slideshow of every image available since 1995 in random order, searching for specific images by date, and saving searched 
          images to the device.

      <h2>Solitaire in Java Swing</h2>
      <div style={{overflow:'auto'}}>
        <img src={solitaire} style={{width:'32vw', float:'right'}}/>
        <p>This project is an exact re-creation of the classic Solitaire card game, using Java's Swing GUI framework. It was designed
          with Object-Oriented Programming and Design Principles and Patterns in mind, and follows roughly a MVC architecture.
          It even has some bonus features, such as multiple card background choices, regular and Klondike game modes, and score keeping.
