        <p>The "NASA Image of the Day" project is an Android based application that displays images from NASA's APOD library.
          For reference, APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) 
          is an <a href='https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/archivepixFull.html' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online archive</a> to which 
          NASA posts a new image every day, with an associated description of the image. This application queries an API using specific
          dates to download images and their associated data from the archive. It is capable of displaying the current image based on the local time/date,
          displaying a slideshow of every image available since 1995 in random order, searching for specific images by date, and saving searched 
          images to the device.

      <h2>Solitaire in Java Swing</h2>
      <div style={{overflow:'auto'}}>
        <img src={solitaire} style={{width:'32vw', float:'right'}}/>
        <p>This project is an exact re-creation of the classic Solitaire card game, using Java's Swing GUI framework. It was designed
          with Object-Oriented Programming and Design Principles and Patterns in mind, and follows roughly a MVC architecture.
          It even has some bonus features, such as multiple card background choices, regular and Klondike game modes, and score keeping.

      <h2>Python Directory Organizer</h2>
      <div style={{overflow:'auto'}}>
      <img src={py1} style={{width:'32vw', float:'right'}}/>
      <p>
        The Python Directory Organizer is a simple project aimed at simplifying folder management. It takes an array of 'rules'
        from a JSON files, defined by a directory name and a list of file extensions. When the script is pointed to a folder and is run,
        it searches in the folder for all files matching the file extensions listed in the ruleset. If found, it will automatically place
        the file in the associated folder, creating the folder if it does not already exist.
        <br/>
        The JSON file containing the ruleset can be opened in any text editor or IDE (or from the convenient link in the app UI),
        and easily changed to the user's preference. The application also features a option to reset the configuration to default, 
        in the event that the ruleset is incorrectly defined.
